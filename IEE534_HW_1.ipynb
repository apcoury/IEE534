    "<h3> 1. The Kirei-Hana Japanese Steak House in San Francisco consumes 3000 pounds of sirloin steak each month. Yama Hirai, the new restraurant manager, recently completed an MBA degree. He learned that the steak was replenished using an EOQ value of 2000 pounds. This EOQ value was computed assuming an interest rate of 36 percent per year. Assume that the current cost of the sirloin steak to the steak house is /$4 per pound. </h3>\n",

    "    (b) Mr. Hirai received an offer from a meat wholesaler in which a discount of 5 percent would be given if the steak house purchased steak in quantities of 3000 pounds or more. Should Mr. Hirai accept the offer from the wholesaler? If so, how much can be saved?\n",
